# DMC3-PAC-TOOLS
Extractor &amp; Repacker All File .pac DMC3 (PS2/Windows/Ubisoft)
# Features & Functions
- Simple GUI and menu bar display.
- Browse menu to search for .pac files from your PC/laptop storage directory.
- Browse menu to search for the .index file so you can repackage the .pac file resulting from your modding.
- Drag/Drop .pac or .index auto run does not use the CLI (it may not work on some devices but browser is also provided).
- Extract results log according to time (real time), and the directory of the extracted .pac file is also displayed
- Log the repack results according to the time (real time), and also display the directory of the results of repacking the .index file into a new .pac
- There are only a few bugs, but I'm only 80% sure it's optimal, and yes, the support in Winlator also runs smoothly and lightly
